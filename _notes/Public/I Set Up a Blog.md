Because maybe I will take more notes and occassionally remember things.

I used [this repo](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) to set up a blog.

Haven't used Obsidian before, we will see how it goes.

Danger zone: public plans. I'd like to add the following improvements over time:
- [ ] lede/lead field for enticing snippets
- [ ] switch between "clickbait" and "normal" mode (separate titles, maybe separate ledes)
- [ ] maybe look into images, but not too fussed about that for now
- [ ] maybe some form of tagging, although backlinks might be a nicer way of discovery
- [ ] move hosting to my private server

[[Why Is This Blog Called inxui?]]?
