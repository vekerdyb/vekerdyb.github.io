Problem: 
- I look things up, use them, forget them, need to look them up again next time.
- Google (and other search engines) keep data, but not for my benefit.
- Second brain apps, note-taking, blogging, etc. require discipline which I don't have.

Idea: 
- A browser extension that inspects searches and if I spend time on results, saves them
- It would tag each result with the search query terms
- Maybe it would look out for a set of pages (e.g. Stack Overflow, MDN, Python docs, etc)
- It would allow to add other pages with a single click / shortcut, marking it as the "right answer"
- It would create a summary each week with questions I found the answer for.
- It would offer the option to export the results so that other apps can take them
- It would be privacy concious, only keeping data locally
